4. **Set Up Node.js Application on N0C**

   **Important:** During the application creation step, specify the following JavaScript entry file:

   `server/server.js`

5. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Copy and rename the `.env-sample` file to `.env`. Enter the required variable values.

6. **Deploy Your Application**

   Run the deploy command:

   `npm run deploy`

## About the Deploy Script
- Runs the build command
- Sets environment variables
- Restarts the application

The web server `Passenger` on N0C does not support `.mjs`files.
The deploy script creates a `server.js` file in the `server` directory that imports the `index.mjs` to bypass this limitation.
It also removes the `package.json` file from the `server` directory.

Enjoy deploying your Nuxt.js application with ease!
